# Learn Python the Hard Way

Exercises for Zed A. Shaw's great book: [Learn Python The Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/). 

I started studying this book to learn Python maybe two years ago, so I totally agree with what Shaw said:

> The original Hard Way book and still the most popular way for total beginners to finally learn how to code. Learn Python The Hard Way takes you from absolute zero to able to read and write basic Python to then understand other books on Python. No experience necessary to begin, and you can even try the book out for free to see if the method works for you. If you've always wanted to learn to code but have no idea where to begin, then this book is for you.

Highly recommend this book.
